## Optional: DeepL API Key

By default, translation uses [Lingva](https://github.com/thedaviddelta/lingva-translate) with ML Kit as an offline fallback. For higher quality translations, get a free DeepL API key at [deepl.com/en/pro#developer](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro#developer) and enter it in **Settings → DeepL API Key**.

## Optional: Anki Flashcards

Install [AnkiDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki) and grant PlayTranslate access in Settings to export cards directly to your decks.
