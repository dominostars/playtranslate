/**
 * One live session's feedback machinery: the eager OCR engine warm-up, the
 * startup card (probe checker → warm-up spinner, on screen from live start
 * until the FIRST COMPLETED OCR pass, so the user is never left staring at
 * a dead screen) with its grace and leak-guard timers, the OCR exclusion
 * that keeps the card's own text out of results wherever frames can contain
 * it, the warm-up gate, and the slow-pass tracking that drives the rescue
 * prompt.
 *
 * Created by [CaptureService.startLive], disposed by stopLive and by the
 * next start — the Region-session idiom: the old session is cancelled and
 * replaced atomically, no field-by-field reset checklist on the
 * process-lived service. Every timer runs in [scope], a child of the
 * service scope, so [dispose] kills all of them at once; and an OCR pass
 * finalizer holds a reference to ITS session object plus a membership
 * token, so a pass that outlives its session (native inference cancels
 * lazily) finalizes into a disposed, inert object — structurally unable to
 * touch the next session's state. (The 2026-07-15 adversarial reviews found
 * three interference bugs of exactly that shape in the loose-field version.)
 *
 * Main-confined, like the live-mode mutators that drive it.
