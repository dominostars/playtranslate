 * Result of attempting to play a candidate. Deliberately a generic audio type,

 * can't express.
 *
 * The two `Tts*` cases are the exception: TTS is the always-on floor, so its
 * engine-availability is a system-level terminal outcome that callers like
 * `OriginalSpeaker` surface as alerts. They map 1:1 from `SpeakResult`.
