/**
 * The OCR model-pack reconciler. The on-disk pack set is a PURE function of the
 * installed source languages and their backends, expressed as two sets (see [plan]):
 * **required** (each language's SELECTED backend's packs — drives downloads) and
 * **retained** (each language's ALL backends' packs — protects from deletion). A
 * pack is reclaimed only when it falls out of `retained`, i.e. no installed language
 * can use it — so switching a language's OCR engine keeps the deselected pack on
 * disk for a free re-select; only REMOVING the language orphans it. Pack SHARING is
 * expressed solely by a shared catalog key (ja/zh/en/latin all → "paddle-rec-unified"),
 * so deletion safety is automatic set-math — no refcounts.
 *
 * Split per the lifecycle contract: [plan] is pure (JVM-testable); [applyDownloads]
 * is the suspend/IO effect (additive, safe to run anytime); [sweepOrphans] deletes
 * orphans and MUST run only at quiescence (no live session), wired in Phase 3.
 * Nothing here closes a live native session — selection only mutates Prefs, and the
 * registry resolves fresh on the next `engineFor`.
