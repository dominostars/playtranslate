/**
 * Post-recognition line assembly: stitches a detector's recognized sub-line
 * (per-word) regions into line regions, so the shared [LayoutAnalyzer] receives
 * the one-region-per-line input it assumes.
 *
 * **Why post-recognition** (and not pre): PaddleOCR DBNet emits one box per word
 * on word-spaced scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, Korean);
 * [com.playtranslate.ocr.composites.DetectThenRecognize] recognizes each box 1:1
 * from its *own* true DBNet deskew quad, THEN hands the recognized regions here,
 * where we stitch the recognized *text*. Merging boxes into one fabricated crop
 * *before* recognition (the pre-recognition approach) would throw away each word's
 * deskew quad and feed a single upright AABB to the recognizer — corrupting
 * slanted/perspective text and mixing font sizes into one bad crop. Recognizing
 * first avoids that entirely: each word is read from its correct quad, and
 * assembly is a pure text/layout operation. This is the docTR `DocumentBuilder`
 * architecture (recognize words → group); the grouping thresholds mirror docTR
 * `_resolve_lines` + EasyOCR `group_text_box`.
 *
 * Scope is decided UPSTREAM (only `emitsSubLineBoxes` detectors on a
 * `wordsSeparatedByWhitespace` source language). Within that, [assembleLines]:
 *  - applies a **collective-orientation guard** — a vertical-dominant capture
 *    (genuine vertical text, e.g. rare vertical Korean) is returned untouched so
 *    its orientation survives for [LayoutAnalyzer]'s vertical path;
 *  - bands the rest into horizontal lines by vertical CENTER, with the tolerance
 *    scaled to the **current line's mean height** (local, not a frame-wide median —
 *    so a large title can't widen the band and swallow a smaller row);
 *  - admits a box to a line only if its height is within [HEIGHT_THS]× the line's
 *    mean height (EasyOCR `height_ths` — the mixed-font-size guard);
 *  - splits a band on horizontal gaps > [GAP_THS]× the line height (column breaks).
 *
 * Pure geometry in [assembleLineIndices]; [assembleLines] adds the text + char-box
 * stitch (carrying per-word [CharBox]es into the line with offsets rebased).
 * Pinned by `LineAssemblyTest`.
