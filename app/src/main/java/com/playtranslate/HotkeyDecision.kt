/**
 * Pure decision logic for hotkey combo detection. Extracted from
 * [PlayTranslateAccessibilityService.checkHotkeyCombos] so the state machine
 * can be unit-tested without mocking the accessibility service.
 *
 * The problem this solves: if the user binds both `A` and `A+B`, pressing
 * them together can briefly look like "A alone" for a few ms before `B`
 * arrives, causing the wrong combo to fire. The fix is to defer any combo
 * that is a proper subset of another configured combo (a "shadowed" combo)
 * by a short window, giving the chord a chance to complete before we
 * commit. Combos that aren't shadowed fire immediately — zero latency.

 * - Active combos are not upgraded to larger combos while held. Once `A+B`
 *   has activated, pressing an extra `C` (even if `A+B+C` is configured)
 *   does not swap modes — the user must release and re-press to change.
 * - A "shadowed" combo (proper subset of another configured combo) is
 *   always deferred. Non-shadowed combos fire immediately.
 * - When a combo is pending and a larger combo subsequently becomes fully
 *   held, the pending combo is superseded by the larger one, which itself
 *   is either activated immediately or re-deferred depending on whether it
 *   is also shadowed.
