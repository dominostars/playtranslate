/**
 * The little triangle that ties a popup to the thing it describes: drawn to fill
 * the view's bounds, pointing DOWN when the popup sits above its subject and UP
 * when it sits below. Give it the popup's own fill [color] and butt it against
 * the popup's edge (overlapping any stroke) so the two read as one shape.
 *
 * Shared by [WordLookupPopup] (points at the looked-up word) and
 * [PopoverHost] (points at the header button that opened the popover).
