/**
 * Cached wrapper around the system [TextToSpeech] engine.
 *
 * The engine is built once and reused across [speak] calls, so only the first
 * call after a change pays the engine-bind cost.
 *
 * Two mechanisms keep the cache honest:
 *  - Engine switched: each call compares the live system default-engine
 *    package against the one the cached engine was built against, and rebinds
 *    when the user has chosen a different engine.
 *  - Cached binding dead (engine uninstalled, disabled, process killed, or
 *    updated in place): caught lazily. `setLanguage` on a dead binding can't
 *    reach the engine to confirm anything, so it reports the language
 *    unsupported — ambiguous with a genuinely unsupported language. On any
 *    "unsupported" result the engine is rebuilt once and the language
 *    re-checked; a freshly bound engine answers authoritatively. The happy
 *    path (supported language, live engine) never triggers the rebuild.
