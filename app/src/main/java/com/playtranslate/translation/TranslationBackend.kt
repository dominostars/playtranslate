 * client) is owned internally by the implementation.
 *
 * The waterfall in [TranslationBackendRegistry.translate] iterates the
 * registry in priority order and picks the first backend whose
 * [isUsable] returns true and whose [translate] does not throw. A
 * thrown exception falls through to the next backend in the chain.
 *
 * Capability extensions (e.g. [QuotaAware]) are declared on side
 * interfaces so the base contract stays small. Future capabilities
 * (downloadable resources, quota readout, etc.) follow the same
 * pattern — see Capabilities.kt.
