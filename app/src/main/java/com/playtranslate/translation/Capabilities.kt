/**
 * Side interfaces that backends opt into to declare extra capabilities
 * beyond the base [TranslationBackend] contract.
 *
 * The capability-interface pattern lets new metadata land without
 * disturbing existing backends — code that wants the capability does a
 * smart-cast (`val q = backend as? QuotaAware`) and skips backends that
 * don't implement it.
 *
 * Future capabilities will land here following the same pattern.
 * For example, a `Downloadable` interface will surface backends with
 * downloadable assets (model files, ngram tables, etc.) along with
 * progress reporting and a `ensureDownloadedFor(source, target)`
 * method. ML Kit's download story stays internal to MlKitBackend for
 * now; if/when the UI needs to surface model-download progress, the
 * interface lands then.
