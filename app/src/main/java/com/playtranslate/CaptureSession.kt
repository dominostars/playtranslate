 * [CaptureService.processScreenshot]. The caller owns this session
 * for as long as it cares about the outcome; the StateFlow walks
 * through [CaptureState.InProgress] entries and lands on a terminal
 * [CaptureState.Done], [CaptureState.NoText], or
 * [CaptureState.Failed].
 *
 * Sessions exist instead of a service-global "latest result"
 * StateFlow so a fresh consumer (e.g. a per-capture
 * [com.playtranslate.ui.TranslationResultActivity]) can't observe
 * the previous capture's output before its own emissions land —
 * each session's StateFlow is born with the cycle and discarded
 * with it.
