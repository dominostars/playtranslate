Build a source-language pack for PlayTranslate from a kaikki.org
Wiktionary JSON-Lines extract (English Wiktionary's <LANG> entries).

Originally Latin-only (hence the filename); now also handles Korean,
which shares the same Wiktionary→SQLite pipeline because the pack
schema (entry/headword/sense) is script-agnostic. Korean skips Snowball
stemming entirely — runtime morphology is handled by Lucene's Nori
tokenizer in KoreanEngine, so the pack only stores citation-form lemmas.
TODO: rename to `build_wiktionary_dict.py` once nothing in-flight
references the current filename.

One script, parameterised by `--lang`. Supports any source language
that kaikki.org publishes AND that has a `word_frequency` locale in
the `wordfreq` package. Verified list:

    ca cs da de en es fi fr hu id it ko nb nl no pl pt ro sv tr vi

(Norwegian: pass `--lang no` — the kaikki file is named "Norwegian"
but its lang_code is `no`. The wordfreq locale `nb` is substituted
automatically.)

Pipeline
--------
1. Stream the kaikki JSON-Lines file (one JSON object per line).
2. Filter to content-word parts of speech (noun/verb/adj/adv/...).
3. Drop entries where `lang_code` doesn't match `--lang`.
4. Drop rare words (`wordfreq.word_frequency` below MIN_FREQUENCY).
5. Write a SQLite file with the JMdict schema shared by DictionaryManager /
   WiktionaryDictionaryManager (`kanjidic` stays empty for non-JA packs).
6. Write `manifest.json` and produce `<lang>.zip`.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/build_latin_dict.py \\
        --lang fr \\
        --input  /path/to/kaikki-French.jsonl \\
        --output /tmp/fr_pack/

The kaikki.org Wiktionary extracts are at:
    https://kaikki.org/dictionary/<LanguageName>/
Download the per-language JSON-Lines file (typically
`kaikki.org-dictionary-<LanguageName>.jsonl`).

After running:
1. `sha256sum /tmp/<lang>_pack/<lang>.zip` — note the hex digest.
2. Create a release tagged `<lang>-v1` on
   `github.com/dominostars/playtranslate-langpacks` and upload the zip.
3. Edit `app/src/main/assets/langpack_catalog.json` — add the `<lang>`
   entry with the release URL and the computed sha256.

Schema notes
------------
- `headword.text`  -> lemma surface (position 0), Snowball stem (position 1),
                     or redirect alias (position 2). See the alias pass in
                     build_sqlite for what position 2 represents.
- `reading.text`   -> UNUSED for Latin (no pronunciation data).
- `sense.glosses` -> TAB-separated list of English definitions (matches
                    JMdict's sense format).
- `sense.pos`     -> Wiktionary's `pos` field, lowercased.
- `sense.misc`    -> Empty for now; reserved for usage notes later.
- `entry.is_common` -> 1 if `word_frequency >= COMMON_FREQUENCY`.
- `entry.freq_score` -> 0..100 scaled log frequency, used for result ordering.

Content filters
---------------
- Only POS in CONTENT_POS. Proper nouns (`name`) are excluded — they
  add noise without translation value for game text.
- Multi-word headwords > 3 words are dropped.
- Entries with zero non-blank glosses are dropped.
- Caps per-entry to 8 senses to keep pack size down.
